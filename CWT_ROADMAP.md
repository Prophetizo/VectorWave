# Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing full Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) functionality in VectorWave. This will be a major feature addition following the 1.0.0 release.

**Target Release**: 1.1.0 or 2.0.0 (depending on scope of breaking changes)

## Current State (1.0.0)

VectorWave currently has:
- Basic `ContinuousWavelet` interface in the API
- `MorletWavelet` implementation that discretizes for DWT use
- No true CWT engine or time-frequency analysis capabilities

## Proposed CWT Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. CWT Engine (`ai.prophetizo.wavelet.cwt.CWTEngine`)
```java
public class CWTEngine {
    // Perform CWT with specified scales
    CWTResult transform(double[] signal, double[] scales, ContinuousWavelet wavelet);
    
    // Perform CWT with frequency range
    CWTResult transformByFrequency(double[] signal, FrequencyRange range, 
                                   double samplingRate, ContinuousWavelet wavelet);
}
```

#### 2. CWT Result (`ai.prophetizo.wavelet.cwt.CWTResult`)
```java
public interface CWTResult {
    // Get complex coefficients at (time, scale)
    Complex coefficient(int timeIndex, int scaleIndex);
    
    // Get magnitude scalogram
    double[][] getMagnitude();
    
    // Get phase scalogram
    double[][] getPhase();
    
    // Get scales used
    double[] getScales();
    
    // Convert scales to frequencies
    double[] getFrequencies(double samplingRate);
}
```

### Wavelet Families to Implement

#### Complex Wavelets
1. **Complex Morlet** - Primary wavelet for time-frequency analysis
   - Configurable bandwidth parameter (ω₀)
   - Optimal time-frequency localization
   
2. **Complex Gaussian Derivatives**
   - Multiple orders for different applications
   
3. **Shannon Wavelet**
   - Ideal frequency localization

#### Real Wavelets
1. **Mexican Hat (Ricker)**
   - 2nd derivative of Gaussian
   - Edge detection in financial data
   
2. **Derivative of Gaussian (DOG)**
   - Multiple orders (1-6)
   
3. **Paul Wavelet**
   - Asymmetric feature detection
   
4. **Bump Wavelet**
   - Compact frequency support

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. FFT-Based Convolution
- Use FFT for long signals (N > 1000)
- Automatic algorithm selection based on signal length
- Pre-compute wavelet FFTs for multiple scales

#### 2. Vectorization
- Extend existing SIMD support to CWT operations
- Platform-specific optimizations (AVX2, ARM NEON)

#### 3. Parallel Processing
- Process multiple scales concurrently
- Integration with `ParallelWaveletEngine`

### Finance-Specific Features

#### 1. Time-Frequency Analysis Tools
```java
public class CWTAnalyzer {
    // Extract instantaneous frequency
    double[] instantaneousFrequency(CWTResult cwt);
    
    // Find ridge (dominant frequency over time)
    Ridge extractRidge(CWTResult cwt);
    
    // Measure coherence between two signals
    CoherenceResult coherence(CWTResult cwt1, CWTResult cwt2);
}
```

#### 2. Financial Applications
- **Volatility Cone**: Multi-scale volatility analysis
- **Market Cycle Detection**: Identify periodic patterns
- **Regime Change Detection**: Frequency content changes
- **Cross-Market Analysis**: Lead-lag relationships

### Streaming CWT

```java
public class StreamingCWTEngine implements StreamingWaveletTransform {
    // Real-time CWT with sliding window
    // Efficient scale-based buffering
    // Continuous scalogram updates
}
```

### Inverse CWT

```java
public class InverseCWT {
    // Reconstruct signal from CWT coefficients
    double[] reconstruct(CWTResult cwt);
    
    // Partial reconstruction (frequency band selection)
    double[] reconstructBand(CWTResult cwt, FrequencyRange band);
}
```

## API Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: Follow existing VectorWave patterns
2. **Type Safety**: Use sealed interfaces where appropriate
3. **Performance**: Provide both accuracy and speed options
4. **Finance Focus**: Include finance-specific conveniences

## Performance Targets

- Process 1M samples with 64 scales in < 100ms
- Memory usage: O(N×S) where N=signal length, S=scales
- Streaming mode: < 10μs per sample latency
- Accuracy: < 1e-10 error vs reference implementation

## Testing Strategy

1. **Accuracy Tests**: Compare with MATLAB/Python implementations
2. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against other Java libraries
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle boundary conditions properly
4. **Financial Scenarios**: Real-world market data tests

## Documentation Plan

1. **Theory Guide**: CWT mathematical foundation
2. **Implementation Guide**: Algorithm choices explained
3. **Financial Applications**: Use cases with examples
4. **API Reference**: Comprehensive JavaDoc
5. **Migration Guide**: Moving from DWT to CWT

## Breaking Changes Consideration

The CWT implementation should be additive, avoiding breaking changes to existing APIs. However, if significant refactoring benefits both DWT and CWT, consider:
- Making this a 2.0.0 release
- Providing migration tools
- Maintaining 1.x branch for stability

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All planned wavelets implemented
2. **Performance**: Meets or exceeds targets
3. **Quality**: >90% test coverage
4. **Usability**: Clear examples for common use cases
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing features

## Future Enhancements (Post-CWT)

1. **Wavelet Packets**: Adaptive time-frequency tiling
2. **Synchrosqueezing**: Improved time-frequency resolution
3. **Empirical Mode Decomposition**: Data-driven decomposition
4. **GPU Acceleration**: For massive scale analysis
