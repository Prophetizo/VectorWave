# Deprecated Functionality Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed all deprecated functionality from the VectorWave codebase to maintain a clean and focused API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Classes
- **BatchSIMDTransform** (`/src/main/java/ai/prophetizo/wavelet/internal/BatchSIMDTransform.java`)
  - This was a DWT-specific SIMD implementation that performed downsampling
  - Incompatible with MODWT's non-decimating philosophy
  - Users should use `MODWTTransform.forwardBatch()` for batch processing

### 2. Removed Test Files
- **BatchSIMDTransformThreadLocalTest** (`/src/test/java/ai/prophetizo/wavelet/internal/BatchSIMDTransformThreadLocalTest.java`)
  - Test for the removed BatchSIMDTransform class

### 3. Removed Methods
- **BatchSIMDMODWT.cleanupThreadLocals()** 
  - Deprecated method that was replaced by `ThreadLocalManager.cleanupCurrentThread()`
  - Updated all callers to use ThreadLocalManager directly

### 4. Updated References
- **BatchProcessingDemo**: 
  - Changed from `BatchSIMDTransform.getBatchSIMDInfo()` to `MODWTBatchSIMD.getBatchSIMDInfo()`
  - Removed `BatchSIMDTransform.cleanupThreadLocals()` call
- **MODWTBatchProcessingDemo**: 
  - Already using `MODWTBatchSIMD.getBatchSIMDInfo()`
- **BatchSIMDMODWTTest**: 
  - Updated to use `ThreadLocalManager.cleanupCurrentThread()` directly
- **BatchSIMDMODWTBenchmark**: 
  - Updated to use `ThreadLocalManager.cleanupCurrentThread()` directly

## Migration Guide

### For DWT Users
If you were using BatchSIMDTransform for DWT operations:
1. Consider whether you really need DWT (with downsampling)
2. If yes, you'll need to implement your own DWT batch processing
3. If no, migrate to MODWT using `MODWTTransform.forwardBatch()`

### For Cleanup Operations
Replace:
```java
BatchSIMDMODWT.cleanupThreadLocals();
```

With:
```java
ThreadLocalManager.cleanupCurrentThread();
```

Or better yet, use the try-with-resources pattern:
```java
try (ThreadLocalManager.CleanupScope scope = ThreadLocalManager.createScope()) {
    // Your batch processing code here
}
```

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Cleaner API**: No confusion between DWT and MODWT operations
2. **Consistent Philosophy**: All transforms now preserve signal length
3. **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer classes to maintain and test
4. **Clear Direction**: Focus on MODWT as the primary transform

## Verification
- ✅ All source code compiles successfully
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No remaining deprecated annotations in production code
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect changes
