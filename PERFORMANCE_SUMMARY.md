| 512 samples | 1.08 μs | 1.68 μs | 3.25 μs |
| 1024 samples | 2.19 μs | 3.86 μs | 5.28 μs |

### Round-Trip Performance (Forward + Inverse)

| Signal Size | Haar | DB2 | DB4 |
|------------|------|-----|-----|
| 256 samples | 1.85 μs | 2.64 μs | 3.39 μs |

### 2. **Batch Processing**
- Optimized for processing multiple price series
- Memory pool reuse across batch operations
- **Result**: Consistent performance without GC spikes

### 3. **Statistical Preservation**
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Numerical stability for financial calculations
- **Result**: Machine precision accuracy maintained

## Benchmark Configuration

All benchmarks run with:
- Java 21+ with G1GC
- 2GB heap allocation
- 5 warmup iterations, 10 measurement iterations
- Intel/Apple Silicon processors

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### 1. **SIMD Vectorization** (✓ Completed)
- Java Vector API integration for parallel processing
- Automatic selection between scalar and vector operations
- **Achieved**: 1.5-3x improvement for signals > 256 samples
- **Note**: Requires JVM flag `--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector` (automatically configured)

### 2. **GPU Acceleration**
- CUDA/OpenCL for massive batch processing
- Target: 10-100x improvement for large batches

### 3. **Streaming Transforms**
- Real-time processing without full signal buffering
- Target: Constant memory usage regardless of signal length

## Usage Recommendations

### For Optimal Performance:

1. **Use appropriate wavelet for your data**:
   - Haar: Fastest, good for step-like signals
   - DB2: Balance of speed and smoothness
   - DB4: Better frequency localization, slower

2. **Batch similar-sized signals together**:
   - Enables memory pool reuse
   - Improves cache efficiency

3. **For long-lived MultiLevelTransformResult objects**:
   ```java
   if (result.getCacheMemoryUsage() > 1_000_000) {
       result.clearCache();
   }
   ```

4. **Use periodic boundary mode when possible**:
   - Fastest boundary handling
   - Appropriate for cyclic data
