## Usage Recommendations

### For Optimal Performance:

1. **Use appropriate wavelet for your data**:
   - Haar: Fastest (~107 ns/op for 64 samples), good for step-like signals
   - DB2: Balance of speed and smoothness (~193 ns/op for 64 samples)
   - DB4: Better frequency localization (~294 ns/op for 64 samples)

2. **Batch similar-sized signals together**:
   - Enables memory pool reuse
   - Improves cache efficiency

3. **For long-lived MultiLevelTransformResult objects**:
   ```java
   if (result.getCacheMemoryUsage() > 1_000_000) {
       result.clearCache();
   }
   ```

4. **Use periodic boundary mode when possible**:
   - Fastest boundary handling
   - Appropriate for cyclic data

5. **Configure optimization paths appropriately**:
   ```java
   // Force scalar for debugging/compatibility
   TransformConfig.builder().forceScalar(true).build()
   
   // Force SIMD for maximum performance
   TransformConfig.builder().forceSIMD(true).build()
   
   // Auto-detect (default)
   TransformConfig.builder().build()
   ```
