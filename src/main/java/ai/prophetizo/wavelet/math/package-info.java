/**
 * Mathematical types and operations for wavelet transforms.
 * 
 * <p>This package contains fundamental mathematical types used across
 * the wavelet transform library, including:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ai.prophetizo.wavelet.math.Complex} - Complex number representation for
 *       complex-valued wavelets and Fourier transforms</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>These types are designed to be immutable and efficient, supporting
 * high-performance mathematical operations required by wavelet transforms.</p>
