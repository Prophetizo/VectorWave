/**
 * Represents the result of a MODWT (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform).
 * 
 * <p>MODWT produces non-decimated coefficients that maintain the same length as the input signal.
 * This results in a shift-invariant transform that can handle arbitrary length signals.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For a signal of length N, both approximation and detail coefficients will have length N,
 * making the transform redundant but preserving all temporal information.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * MODWTTransform modwt = new MODWTTransform(new Haar(), BoundaryMode.PERIODIC);
 * double[] signal = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
 * 
 * MODWTResult result = modwt.forward(signal);
 * double[] approximation = result.approximationCoeffs(); // length 8
 * double[] detail = result.detailCoeffs();               // length 8
 * }</pre>
