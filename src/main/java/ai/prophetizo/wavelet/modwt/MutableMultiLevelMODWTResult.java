/**
 * Mutable extension of MultiLevelMODWTResult that allows direct coefficient modification.
 *

 * directly, such as thresholding for denoising, coefficient filtering, or implementing
 * custom processing algorithms like those used in the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT).</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Direct coefficient modification can break the wavelet
 * representation's mathematical properties. Ensure modifications are appropriate for
 * your use case and consider the impact on reconstruction accuracy.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Implementations are not thread-safe. External
 * synchronization is required for concurrent access.</p>
