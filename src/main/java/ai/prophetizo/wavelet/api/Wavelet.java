/**
 * Base interface for all wavelet types in the VectorWave library.
 *
 * <p>This sealed interface hierarchy ensures type safety while supporting
 * various wavelet categories including discrete (orthogonal, biorthogonal)
 * and continuous wavelets.</p>
 *
 * <p>All wavelets must provide filter coefficients for decomposition and
 * reconstruction, though the method of obtaining these coefficients may
 * vary (e.g., predefined for discrete wavelets, discretized for continuous).</p>

 * <h2>Wavelet Type Hierarchy:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Wavelet
 * ├── DiscreteWavelet
 * │   ├── OrthogonalWavelet (Haar, Daubechies, Symlets, Coiflets)
 * │   └── BiorthogonalWavelet (Biorthogonal Splines)
 * └── ContinuousWavelet (Morlet, Mexican Hat, etc.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Get a wavelet by type
 * Wavelet haar = new Haar();
 * Wavelet db4 = Daubechies.DB4;
 *
 * // Get wavelet from registry
 * Wavelet wavelet = WaveletRegistry.getWavelet("db4");
 *
 * // Use with transform
 * WaveletTransform transform = new WaveletTransform(wavelet, BoundaryMode.PERIODIC);
