# Modern Java Features in VectorWave

This document summarizes the modern Java features (Java 14-21+) being leveraged in the VectorWave project.

## Language Features

### 1. Records (Java 14+)
Records are used extensively throughout the codebase for immutable data carriers:
- `Haar`, `Daubechies` - Wavelet implementations
- `Complex` - Complex number representation
- `CacheInfo` in `PlatformDetector` - Platform cache configuration
- `CWTResult` - Continuous wavelet transform results
- Various padding strategies (`PeriodicPaddingStrategy`, etc.)

### 2. Pattern Matching for instanceof (Java 16+)
Pattern matching simplifies type checks and casts:
```java
// Example from WaveletTransformPool.java
if (wavelet instanceof DiscreteWavelet discreteWavelet) {
    // Use discreteWavelet directly
}
```

### 3. Switch Expressions (Java 14+)
Switch expressions provide cleaner, more functional code:
```java
// Example from PlatformDetector.java
return switch (CURRENT_PLATFORM) {
    case APPLE_SILICON -> 8;
    case ARM -> 8;
    case X86_64 -> 16;
    case UNKNOWN -> 32;
};
```

### 4. Sealed Classes (Java 17+)
Used for the wavelet type hierarchy to ensure type safety:
- `Wavelet` is a sealed interface
- `TransformResult` is a sealed interface

## API Features

### 1. Vector API (Incubator)
The Vector API is used extensively for SIMD operations:
- `compress()` method in `GatherScatterOps` (Java 23)
- `DoubleVector` and `VectorSpecies` for vectorized operations
- Platform-specific optimizations (ARM, x86)

### 2. Virtual Threads (Java 21+)
A new `VirtualThreadWaveletEngine` class leverages virtual threads for:
- Better scalability with thousands of concurrent operations
- Reduced memory overhead compared to platform threads
- Simplified concurrent programming model

Example usage:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```

## Build Configuration

### Maven Configuration
- Project configured with `<maven.compiler.release>23</maven.compiler.release>`
- CI/CD pipeline uses Java 23 via GitHub Actions

### Module Configuration
- Uses `jdk.incubator.vector` module for Vector API
- Proper module flags in Maven configuration

## Performance Benefits

1. **Virtual Threads**: Better scalability for I/O-bound operations and fine-grained parallelism
2. **Vector API**: 2-8x performance improvements for SIMD operations
3. **Records**: Reduced memory footprint and better cache locality
4. **Pattern Matching**: Cleaner code with potential JIT optimization benefits

## Future Java Features to Consider

1. **String Templates** (Preview in Java 21+): Could simplify string formatting in logging and error messages
2. **Structured Concurrency** (Preview): When stable, could replace manual Future management
3. **Value Objects** (Project Valhalla): Could further optimize data structures like Complex numbers

## Compatibility Notes

- The project requires Java 23 or later
- Vector API is still in incubator status
- Some features (like StructuredTaskScope) are preview features and not used to maintain stability
