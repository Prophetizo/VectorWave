# MODWTStreamingTransformImpl Constructor Validation Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the constructor validation in `MODWTStreamingTransformImpl` to prevent integer overflow and enforce reasonable memory limits, as suggested by Copilot.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Integer Overflow Prevention
The circular buffer allocation uses `bufferSize + overlapSize`. Without proper validation, this could cause integer overflow leading to:
- Negative array size exceptions
- Unexpected behavior
- Security vulnerabilities

### 2. Memory Protection
Large buffer sizes could cause out-of-memory errors or consume unreasonable amounts of heap space.

## Implementation

### Validation Checks Added

1. **Integer Overflow Check**
   ```java
   if (bufferSize > Integer.MAX_VALUE - overlapSize) {
       throw new InvalidArgumentException(
           "Buffer size too large, would cause integer overflow: bufferSize=" + bufferSize +
           ", overlapSize=" + overlapSize);
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Size Limit** (100MB max)
   ```java
   long totalSize = (long) bufferSize + overlapSize;
   long memorySizeBytes = totalSize * 8; // 8 bytes per double
   long maxReasonableSize = 100L * 1024 * 1024; // 100MB
   
   if (memorySizeBytes > maxReasonableSize) {
       throw new InvalidArgumentException(
           "Buffer size too large, would require " + (memorySizeBytes / (1024 * 1024)) + "MB. " +
           "Maximum allowed is " + (maxReasonableSize / (1024 * 1024)) + "MB");
   }
   ```

3. **Minimum Size Check**
   ```java
   if (bufferSize < filterLength) {
       throw new InvalidArgumentException(
           "Buffer size must be at least as large as filter length: bufferSize=" + bufferSize +
           ", filterLength=" + filterLength);
   }
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents integer overflow attacks
2. **Stability**: Prevents out-of-memory errors from unreasonable buffer sizes
3. **Usability**: Clear error messages help developers understand constraints
4. **Performance**: Ensures buffers are large enough for meaningful processing

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Valid construction scenarios
- Null parameter validation
- Negative/zero buffer sizes
- Buffer size smaller than filter length
- Integer overflow scenarios
- Memory limit violations
- Edge cases (minimum valid sizes, just below limits)

## Memory Limit Rationale

The 100MB limit was chosen based on:
- Typical streaming scenarios process smaller chunks
- Prevents accidental memory exhaustion
- Still allows for large buffers (up to ~13 million samples)
- Can be adjusted if needed for specific use cases

## Close() Method Fix

Also fixed a race condition in the `close()` method where it was calling `flush()` after marking as closed, causing an `InvalidStateException`. The fix ensures remaining data is processed before marking the transform as closed.

## Sliding Window State Protection

Added defensive programming to protect against negative `samplesInBuffer` state:

1. **Redundant Validation**: Although mathematically impossible with proper validation (since `bufferSize >= filterLength` implies `bufferSize > overlapSize`), we explicitly check `bufferSize > overlapSize` for clarity and defensive programming.

2. **Runtime State Check**: Added defensive check in `processBuffer()` to ensure `samplesConsumed` is positive and doesn't exceed `samplesInBuffer`. This prevents negative buffer state even if validation is bypassed.

3. **Clear Error Messages**: Both compile-time validation and runtime checks provide clear error messages indicating the exact values that caused the issue.

These changes ensure the sliding window mechanism remains robust even in edge cases or if future code changes inadvertently break assumptions.
