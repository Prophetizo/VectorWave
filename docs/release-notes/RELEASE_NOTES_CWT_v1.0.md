## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic CWT Analysis
```java
MorletWavelet wavelet = new MorletWavelet(6.0, 1.0);
CWTTransform cwt = new CWTTransform(wavelet);

// Automatic scale selection
SignalAdaptiveScaleSelector selector = new SignalAdaptiveScaleSelector();
double[] scales = selector.selectScales(signal, wavelet, samplingRate);

// Complex analysis
ComplexCWTResult result = cwt.analyzeComplex(signal, scales);
double[][] magnitude = result.getMagnitude();
double[][] phase = result.getPhase();
```

### Financial Analysis
```java
PaulWavelet paul = new PaulWavelet(4);
FinancialWaveletAnalyzer analyzer = new FinancialWaveletAnalyzer();

// Detect market anomalies
MarketCrashResult crashes = analyzer.detectMarketCrashes(priceData, threshold);

// Analyze volatility patterns
VolatilityResult volatility = analyzer.analyzeVolatilityClustering(returns, scales);
```

### Phase Synchronization
```java
// Analyze coupling between signals
ComplexCWTResult result1 = cwt.analyzeComplex(signal1, scales);
ComplexCWTResult result2 = cwt.analyzeComplex(signal2, scales);

double[][] phase1 = result1.getPhase();
double[][] phase2 = result2.getPhase();

// Calculate synchronization index
double syncIndex = PhaseSynchronization.calculate(phase1, phase2);
```
