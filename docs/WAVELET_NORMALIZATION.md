# Wavelet Normalization Guide

## Overview

Different wavelet implementations use different normalization conventions. This guide explains the normalization used in VectorWave and how it relates to other popular implementations.

## Mexican Hat (DOG2) Wavelet

### Standard Mathematical Form
The DOG2 wavelet uses the standard mathematical normalization:
```
ψ(t) = (2/(√3 * π^(1/4))) * (1 - t²) * exp(-t²/2)
```
- Peak value at t=0: `2/(√3 * π^(1/4)) ≈ 0.867325`
- Zero crossings at t = ±1
- This is the canonical form used in most academic literature

### MATLAB mexihat Form
MATLAB's Wavelet Toolbox uses a different normalization:
```
ψ(t) = C * (1 - (t/σ)²) * exp(-(t/σ)²/2)
```
where:
- σ = 5/√8 ≈ 1.7678
- C = 0.8673250706 (empirically determined)
- This scaling stretches the wavelet and adjusts the amplitude

### Using MATLAB-Compatible Values
For exact MATLAB compatibility, use the `MATLABMexicanHat` class:
```java
ContinuousWavelet mexihat = new MATLABMexicanHat();
```

### Financial Analysis Considerations

#### Why MATLAB Compatibility Matters in Finance

The MATLAB parameterization has become an industry standard in quantitative finance due to:

1. **Historical Precedence**: Most financial wavelet research from the 1990s-2010s used MATLAB
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Risk models validated with MATLAB need exact reproduction
3. **Academic Literature**: Financial papers reference MATLAB's specific scaling
4. **Legacy Systems**: Trading systems calibrated with MATLAB parameters

#### Practical Implications

The MATLAB scaling (σ = 5/√8 ≈ 1.77) affects financial analysis:

- **Volatility Detection**: The wider support (zeros at ±1.77) better captures multi-day volatility clusters
- **Intraday Patterns**: The stretched wavelet aligns with typical 2-3 day persistence in markets
- **Frequency Content**: The scaling affects which market cycles are emphasized

#### When to Use Each Version

**Use MATLABMexicanHat when:**
- Migrating existing MATLAB models to Java
- Reproducing published research results
- Regulatory requirements specify MATLAB compatibility
- Working with legacy trading systems

**Use DOGWavelet(2) when:**
- Building new models without legacy constraints
- Following mathematical literature exactly
- Optimizing for computational efficiency
- Implementing custom scaling strategies

## Paul Wavelet

### Standard Form
The Paul wavelet of order m:
```
ψ(t) = (2^m * i^m * m!) / √(π * (2m)!) * (1 - it)^(-(m+1))
```
- Complex-valued (analytic)
- We return the imaginary part for real signals
- Normalization ensures unit L2 norm

### PyWavelets Compatibility
PyWavelets uses a similar normalization but may have phase differences. The magnitude response should match within numerical precision.

## Shannon Wavelet

### Classical Shannon Wavelet
```
ψ(t) = 2*sinc(2t) - sinc(t)
```
where `sinc(x) = sin(πx)/(πx)`

### Shannon-Gabor Wavelet
Some implementations use a windowed version:
```
ψ(t) = √(f_b/π) * sinc(f_b*t) * exp(2πi*f_c*t)
```

## DOG Wavelets (General)

For DOG wavelets of order n:
```
Normalization factor = 1 / √(2^n * √π * n!)
```

## Choosing a Normalization

1. **For Academic/Research Work**: Use the standard mathematical forms (default in VectorWave)
2. **For MATLAB Compatibility**: Use the MATLAB-specific classes when available
3. **For Cross-Platform Work**: Be aware of normalization differences and document which convention you're using

## Converting Between Normalizations

To convert from one normalization to another, you typically need to:
1. Determine the scaling factor between the two forms
2. Apply any time-axis scaling (σ factor)
3. Adjust the amplitude accordingly

Example: MATLAB to Standard
- Time scaling: t_matlab = t_standard / σ where σ = 5/√8
- Amplitude scaling: Determined empirically or from documentation

## Implementation Notes

- All wavelets in VectorWave satisfy the admissibility condition
- The discretization preserves the normalization as much as possible
- For exact compatibility with other tools, use the tool-specific implementations when available
