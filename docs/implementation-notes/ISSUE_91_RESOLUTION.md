# Issue #91 Resolution Summary

## Problem
Issue #91 identified an inconsistency where:
- PR #80 description claimed the original hardcoded value was `CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 10.0`
- The actual test expected `0.7` as the default value
- This created confusion about which value was correct

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the PR #80 files and comments, it became clear that:
1. The `analyzeCrashAsymmetry()` method returns a **ratio between 0 and 1**
2. The implementation correctly uses `DEFAULT_CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 0.7`
3. The PR description incorrectly stated the original value was 10.0

## Why 0.7 is Correct
- **Method Range**: `analyzeCrashAsymmetry()` returns values between 0-1 (it's a normalized ratio)
- **Logical Threshold**: 0.7 means crash risk is detected when asymmetry exceeds 70%
- **Functional**: With 0.7, the system can actually detect crash conditions
- **Invalid Alternative**: 10.0 would never be exceeded by a method returning 0-1 values

## Evidence from PR #80
Several review comments in PR #80 identified this same inconsistency:
- Comment #2241048893: "The test comment states the original hardcoded value was CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 10.0 but the test expects 0.7"
- Multiple comments noted the mismatch between the claimed 10.0 value and actual 0.7 implementation

## Resolution
- **No code changes required** - the implementation is already correct
- **Documentation clarification** provided to resolve the inconsistency
- **Test documentation** demonstrates why 0.7 is correct and 10.0 would be invalid
- **Future reference** established for developers working with this threshold

## Files Created
1. `CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD_CLARIFICATION.md` - Detailed explanation of the issue and resolution
2. `Issue91DocumentationTest.java` - Test demonstrating the correct understanding

This resolution confirms that the implementation team made the right choice using 0.7, and the PR description simply contained an error in documenting the "original" value.
