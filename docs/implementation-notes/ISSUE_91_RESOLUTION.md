# Issue #91 Resolution Summary

## Problem
Issue #91 identified an inconsistency where:
- PR #80 description claimed the original hardcoded value was `CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 10.0`
- The actual test expected `0.7` as the default value
- This created confusion about which value was correct

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the PR #80 files and comments, it became clear that:
1. The `analyzeCrashAsymmetry()` method returns a **ratio between 0 and 1**
2. The implementation correctly used `DEFAULT_CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 0.7`
3. The PR description incorrectly stated the original value was 10.0

## Why 0.7 was Correct
- **Method Range**: `analyzeCrashAsymmetry()` returns values between 0-1 (it's a normalized ratio)
- **Logical Threshold**: 0.7 means crash risk is detected when asymmetry exceeds 70%
- **Functional**: With 0.7, the system could actually detect crash conditions
- **Invalid Alternative**: 10.0 would never be exceeded by a method returning 0-1 values

## Evidence from PR #80
Several review comments in PR #80 identified this same inconsistency:
- Comment #2241048893: "The test comment states the original hardcoded value was CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 10.0 but the test expects 0.7"
- Multiple comments noted the mismatch between the claimed 10.0 value and actual 0.7 implementation

## Current Status (August 2025)
- **All defaults have been removed** - users must now explicitly configure all thresholds
- The crash asymmetry threshold is no longer hardcoded as 0.7
- Users must specify this value through `FinancialAnalysisConfig.builder().crashAsymmetryThreshold(value)`
- This ensures appropriate values are chosen for each specific use case

## Resolution History
1. **Initial Resolution**: Documentation clarification that 0.7 was correct
2. **Final Resolution**: Complete removal of all defaults to prevent similar issues

## Files Modified
1. `FinancialAnalysisConfig.java` - Removed all DEFAULT_ constants and defaultConfig() method
2. `FinancialAnalyzer.java` - Removed withDefaultConfig() method
3. All tests and demos - Updated to use explicit configurations
4. Documentation - Updated to explain why defaults were removed

This resolution not only fixed the original inconsistency but also improved the overall design by requiring explicit configuration of market-specific parameters.
