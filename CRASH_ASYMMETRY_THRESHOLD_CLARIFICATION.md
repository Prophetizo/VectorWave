# CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD Clarification

## Issue Description
Issue #91 identified an inconsistency regarding the `CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD` value between the PR #80 description and the actual implementation.

## The Inconsistency
- **PR #80 Description**: Claims the original hardcoded value was `CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 10.0`
- **Actual Implementation**: Uses `DEFAULT_CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 0.7`
- **Test Expectations**: Expect the default value to be `0.7`

## Resolution
The **0.7 value is correct** because:

1. The `analyzeCrashAsymmetry()` method returns a ratio between 0 and 1
2. The implementation includes a comment: "Crash asymmetry threshold: The analyzeCrashAsymmetry() method returns a ratio between 0 and 1."
3. A threshold of 10.0 would be impossible to exceed for a method that returns values between 0 and 1

## Corrected Understanding
- **Original Claim**: `CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 10.0` (INCORRECT)
- **Actual Implementation**: `DEFAULT_CRASH_ASYMMETRY_THRESHOLD = 0.7` (CORRECT)
- **Reason**: The method returns a normalized ratio (0-1 range), making 0.7 a realistic threshold

## Impact
This clarification resolves the documentation inconsistency without requiring code changes, as the implementation is already correct.
