## Implementation Guidelines

### API Design Principles
1. **Backward Compatibility** - All enhancements must maintain v1.0 API compatibility
2. **Modular Architecture** - Each enhancement should be independently usable
3. **Performance First** - Maintain VectorWave's performance standards
4. **Zero Dependencies** - Minimize external dependencies, optional where needed

### Quality Standards
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
- JMH benchmarks for performance-critical components
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Mathematical validation against reference implementations

### Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with existing CWT infrastructure
- Consistent API patterns across all modules
- Shared memory management and optimization strategies
- Unified configuration approach

## Resource Estimates
